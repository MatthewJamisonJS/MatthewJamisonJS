## About Me

I used to produce music professionally. Made beats, worked with artists, spent way too many hours in Logic Pro.

Then I discovered I could build stuff that solves actual problems for people.

Now I write Rails apps. Still bring that producer mindset though—composition, iteration, knowing when something just *feels* right.

<br>

I'm hands-on first. Build something, see if it works, trust my gut. Research when it makes sense to, but I'd rather experiment and learn by doing. Every challenge is just another adventure.

Kind of like Gon from Hunter x Hunter, honestly.

<br>

## What I've Been Up To

**Concordia Publishing House**

Contributing to a Rails 8 monolith that serves 500K users. 77+ merged PRs so far—performance optimization, new features, keeping the code clean.

<br>

**[matthewjamison.dev](https://matthewjamison.dev)**

Built my portfolio to showcase what I can do. Seven demo templates across different industries. The whole thing is obsessed with performance and accessibility:

- 98+ Lighthouse scores across all pages
- 79% faster load times through optimization
- WCAG compliance baked in from the start
- $6K in annual savings with smart architecture choices
- Multilingual support (Spanish, Japanese, French, German)

Philosophy: Pick the right tool for the job. Don't chase trends.

<br>

## My Current Toolbox

**Backend:** Ruby, Rails 8, Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus), Phlex

**Frontend:** JavaScript, TailwindCSS, HTML/CSS

**Database:** PostgreSQL

**Tools:** Git, jj, Docker, GitHub Actions

**Focus:** Performance optimization, accessibility, progressive enhancement

<br>

## Sometimes I Play With

**Systems:** Rust when I need raw performance

**Static Sites:** Hugo for blazing-fast content

**E-commerce:** Shopify integrations and custom themes

**AI/ML:** Claude integration, building MCP servers, automation

**Cloud:** Cloudflare Pages, AWS basics

<br>

## Fun Fact

Music production taught me everything about composition and iteration. Those same principles apply to software architecture.

Also, I do a lot of things:

- Still make beats occasionally 🎵
- Watch anime (Hunter x Hunter, Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer)
- Mentor at my local church (Follower of the Way)
- Been married 11 years to my best friend

  🐸 *Frog & Toad 4 Life* 🐸

- Dad to two brilliant daughters (16 and 10)

<br>

I believe in building things that matter, helping people grow, and being present for what's actually important.

Oh, and I'm a polymath. Can't help it. Always learning something new.
